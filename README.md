# A-website-of-JU-CSE
This project is to design a website for students in order to provide useful information of department and keep them updated. They can get notices of department, can see academic calendar, know about department. Each students can see their own result by logging into account. One must have account to see his result. Nobody else is able to view result of others expect of his own result.
Use html, css and php to design layout and fetch information from database. I have use wampserver database as server and run the web application on localhost.
